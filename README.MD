C# library that allows to create, view and edit a list of books. Each book has a title, an author, and number of pages. The library should provide following functionality:

[+] Load a list of books from XML-file.

[+] Add a new book to the list.

[+] Sort the list in alphabetical order by author first. Then for each author sort it in alphabetical order by title. Example: first all Andersen’s books, then all King’s books. Andersen’s books: first The Little Mermaid, then The Ugly Duckling etc.

[+] Book search by a part of its title.

[+] Save the list of books into XML-file.

I use unit tests here, a lot. Because why not lets go
